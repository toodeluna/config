## Introduction

Hello, dear reader! It seems you've stumbled upon my Nix system configuration repository. What
you'll find here are the creations of an insane person on a quest to have the most declarative
and reproducible system configuration possible. This is achieved through the use of Nix, Home
Manager and levels of autism the likes of which have never been seen before!

All jokes aside though, this repo contains a Nix flake that exports configurations for all my
systems. It's entirely tailored to my own use cases and therefore not exactly usable by anyone
who isn't me, but it can still serve as an inspiration for anyone looking to get into Nix. If
certain parts of this repo seem overly complex and unneccesary it's because they probably are,
but I'm also using this project as a means to experiment with various tools and aspects of Nix.

I'll do my best to document this project as clearly as possible so that it's easy to understand
for anyone reading this and also for future me who might forget how parts of this work because
they are very stupid :3.

## More Documentation Coming Soon :3
